# Anagram Part II

This time you're going to check a word against a dictionary of other words.

## Premise
The goal of this exercise is to return a new list of all the anagrams from the provided dictionary

## Example
```
anagrams_for("saltier", ["cognac", "saltier", "realist", "retails"]) == ["saltier", "realist", "retails"]
```

## Challenge Yourself
